    <h1>Welcome to MockMyID.com</h1>

    <p>MockMyID is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/BrowserID">BrowserID</a> Identity Provider (IdP) that will gladly issue assertions to anyone and everyone, without a second thought.</p>

    <p>It's like <a href="http://mailinator.com">Mailinator</a>, for BrowserID.</p>

    <p>It's especially useful for testing and demoing sites that depend on BrowserID, since you don't have to set up email or accounts beforehand.</p>

    <h2>How Do I Use It?</h2>

    <p>Whenever you're asked to log in with BrowserID, just make up any email address you want <code>@mockmyid.com</code>.</p>

    <h2>Where's the Code?</h2>

    <p>At <a href="https://github.com/callahad/mockmyid">github.com/callahad/mockmyid</a>.</p>
